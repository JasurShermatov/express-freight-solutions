      question: "What is the difference between FTL and LTL?",
      answer: "FTL (Full Truckload) is for full truckloads where you rent the entire truck for your shipment, providing faster delivery and direct routing. LTL (Less than Truckload) allows you to share truck space with other shipments, making it cost-effective for smaller loads that don't require a full truck."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer refrigerated transport?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide temperature-controlled trucking for sensitive and perishable goods. Our refrigerated units maintain precise temperature control throughout the journey, with continuous monitoring and compliance documentation for pharmaceutical and food-grade shipments."
    },
    {
      question: "Which states do you currently serve?",
      answer: "We are based in Lebanon, Ohio and are expanding across the USA. Currently, we serve Ohio and surrounding states with plans to cover most major routes nationwide. Our strategic location provides excellent access to major interstate corridors and distribution centers."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I request a shipping quote?",
      answer: "Simply fill out our contact form with your shipping details, call us directly at +1 (347) 327-5234, or email us at cincinnatiexpressllc@gmail.com. We'll provide a personalized quote based on your specific needs, including pickup/delivery locations, cargo type, and timeline."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide GPS tracking for shipments?",
      answer: "Yes, all our trucks are equipped with real-time GPS tracking systems. You'll receive tracking information and regular updates on your shipment's location and estimated delivery time. Our tracking provides complete visibility and peace of mind throughout the transportation process."
    },
    {
      question: "Are your services available 24/7?",

    },
    {
      question: "What types of cargo do you transport?",
      answer: "We transport a wide variety of cargo including general freight, temperature-sensitive goods, manufactured products, raw materials, and more. Our fleet includes standard dry vans, refrigerated units, and specialized equipment to handle different cargo types safely and efficiently."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure cargo safety and security?",
      answer: "We maintain the highest safety standards through professional drivers, regular vehicle maintenance, cargo insurance coverage, and secure loading procedures. All shipments are handled with care, and we provide documentation and tracking throughout the transportation process."
